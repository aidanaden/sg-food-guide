# React Best Practices (Local Variant)

This project uses a local, framework-agnostic variant of the Vercel React best practices skill.

- Canonical guidance is in `SKILL.md` and `rules/*.md` in this folder.
- Next.js-specific rules have been intentionally removed for this repository.
- This file intentionally replaces the upstream compiled AGENTS artifact to avoid stale references.
